## 🏗️ Section 1 — Understanding the Moving Parts

Before we explain the flow, let's understand what each "thing" is.

### What is JIRA?
JIRA is a project management tool. Teams use it to track work — bugs, features,
tasks. Every item in JIRA is called a **ticket** or **issue**, and each ticket
has a unique ID like `PROJ-123`.

```
Example JIRA ticket:
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PROJ-123                              │
│  Title: User cannot log in             │
│  Type: Bug                             │
│  Status: In Progress                   │
│  Assigned to: Jane                     │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### What is XRAY?
XRAY is a **plugin** (add-on) for JIRA that adds testing features.
Without XRAY, JIRA has no concept of test cases or test results.
XRAY adds three new ticket types:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   TEST CASE     │    │   TEST SET      │    │ TEST EXECUTION  │
│   (PROJ-101)    │    │   (PROJ-456)    │    │   (PROJ-789)    │
│                 │    │                 │    │                 │
│ One specific    │    │ A folder/list   │    │ A report card   │
│ test scenario   │    │ grouping test   │    │ showing results │
│                 │    │ cases together  │    │ of a test run   │
│                 │    │                 │    │                 │
│ "Verify login   │    │ Contains:       │    │ PROJ-101: PASS  │
│  works with     │    │  - PROJ-101     │    │ PROJ-102: FAIL  │
│  valid creds"   │    │  - PROJ-102     │    │ PROJ-103: TODO  │
│                 │    │  - PROJ-103     │    │                 │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘

```

> **⚠️ KEY RULE: Test Cases and Test Sets are MANUAL. Test Executions onward are AUTOMATIC.**
>
> QA creates Test Cases and Test Sets **manually in JIRA** (one-time setup).
> Playwright creates Test Executions, runs tests, marks PASS/FAIL, and uploads
> screenshots **automatically** every time you run `npm test`.
> See **[CAPABILITIES.md → JIRA XRAY Integration](CAPABILITIES.md#-jira-xray-integration)**
> for the complete step-by-step setup guide.

### What is Playwright?
Playwright is a tool that **controls a web browser like a robot**.
It can open Chrome, go to a URL, click buttons, type text, and check if
things are correct — all automatically, without a human doing it.

```
Without Playwright (manual):        With Playwright (automated):
─────────────────────────────       ──────────────────────────────
1. Human opens Chrome               1. Code opens Chrome
2. Human types the URL              2. Code types the URL
3. Human clicks "Login"             3. Code clicks "Login"
4. Human types email/password       4. Code types email/password
5. Human clicks "Submit"            5. Code clicks "Submit"
6. Human checks if it worked        6. Code checks if it worked
7. Human writes down the result     7. Code saves result automatically
                                    8. Code reports to JIRA XRAY
```

## 🔑 Section 2 — How Authentication Works

**Authentication** = "Proving who you are to JIRA before it lets you in"

Think of it like showing your employee badge at a security gate.
JIRA doesn't let just anyone access its data — you must prove you have permission.

### How our framework authenticates:

```
YOUR .env FILE                    JIRA SERVER
─────────────                     ───────────
JIRA_BASE_URL   ─────────────────→ "OK, I know this server"
JIRA_USERNAME   ──┐
JIRA_API_TOKEN  ──┴──(combined)──→ "Verified! You are John Doe.
                                    You have permission to read/write."
```

### What is an API Token?
A regular password is for humans. An **API Token** is a special password
for programs/scripts to use. It's safer because:
- You can create one specifically for this automation
- If it gets compromised, you can delete just that token
- It doesn't expose your real account password

**Where this happens in code:** `utils/jira-xray/jira-auth.ts`

**In plain English, that file does:**
1. Reads your username and API token from `.env`
2. Combines them like: `"john@company.com:mytoken123"`
3. Scrambles it into a safe format (called Base64)
4. Attaches this to every single JIRA request as proof of identity

---

## 📋 Section 3 — How Test Cases Are Fetched from XRAY Test Set

This is **ACT 1, Step 2** of the framework. Here's exactly what happens:

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough

**What you set up in `.env`:**
```
XRAY_TEST_SET_ID=PROJ-456
```

**What the framework does:**

```
FRAMEWORK                              JIRA XRAY API
─────────                              ─────────────

Step 1: "Hey JIRA, tell me about                     PROJ-456
         ticket PROJ-456"         ────────────────→  ┌───────────────────┐
                                                      │ Title: Login Tests│
                                  ←────────────────   │ Created by: Jane  │
                                                      │ Sprint: 5         │
                                                      └───────────────────┘

Step 2: "Hey XRAY, what test                         PROJ-456 contains:
         cases are IN PROJ-456?"  ────────────────→  ┌───────────────────┐
                                                      │ - PROJ-101        │
                                  ←────────────────   │ - PROJ-102        │
                                                      │ - PROJ-103        │
                                                      └───────────────────┘

Step 3: "Hey JIRA, give me full
         details of PROJ-101,
         PROJ-102, PROJ-103"      ────────────────→  Returns name, steps,
                                                      expected results for
                                  ←────────────────   each test case

Step 4: Framework builds a clean
        list in memory:
        [
          { key: "PROJ-101", name: "Valid login test", steps: [...] },
          { key: "PROJ-102", name: "Wrong password test", steps: [...] },
          { key: "PROJ-103", name: "Empty fields test", steps: [...] }
        ]
```

**Where this happens in code:** `utils/jira-xray/xray-test-set.ts`

## 🚀 Section 4 — How a Test Execution Is Created in JIRA XRAY

This is **ACT 1, Step 3**. A **Test Execution** is a new JIRA ticket that
acts as a "container" for the results of one complete test run.

### Why Create a Test Execution?

Think of it like an **exam result sheet**:
- The Test Set (`PROJ-456`) is the **list of subjects** on the syllabus
- The Test Execution (`PROJ-789`) is the **result sheet for one exam date**
- Each sprint gets its own result sheet, so you can compare over time

```
Sprint 3 Test Execution              Sprint 4 Test Execution
(PROJ-700, created 1-Feb-2026)       (PROJ-789, created 15-Feb-2026)
─────────────────────────────        ──────────────────────────────
PROJ-101: PASS                       PROJ-101: PASS
PROJ-102: FAIL   ← was failing       PROJ-102: PASS   ← now fixed!
PROJ-103: PASS                       PROJ-103: FAIL   ← new bug!
```

### What the Framework Creates

```
FRAMEWORK                              JIRA XRAY
─────────                              ─────────

"Create a new Test Execution
 with these details:"              ─────────────────────────────────→

 {                                     JIRA creates ticket:
   type: "Test Execution",             ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
   summary: "Sprint 5 —               │ PROJ-789                        │
     Playwright Run [28-Feb-2026]",    │ Sprint 5 — Playwright Run       │
   project: "PROJ"                     │  [28-Feb-2026]                  │
 }                                     │ Type: Test Execution            │
                                       │ Status: In Progress             │
                                   ←── │ Tests linked: (see below)       │
 "Got it! Execution key: PROJ-789"     └─────────────────────────────────┘

"Now link these test cases
 to PROJ-789:"
 ["PROJ-101", "PROJ-102",          ─────────────────────────────────→
  "PROJ-103"]
                                       PROJ-789 now shows:
                                       ┌────────────────────────────────┐
                                       │ PROJ-101: TODO (not run yet)   │
                                       │ PROJ-102: TODO (not run yet)   │
                                       │ PROJ-103: TODO (not run yet)   │
                                       └────────────────────────────────┘

Framework saves "PROJ-789" to
a file called xray-state.json
(like a sticky note for later)
```

**Where this happens in code:** `utils/jira-xray/xray-test-execution.ts`

---

## 🎭 Section 5 — How Playwright Knows Which Tests to Run

This is the **most important question** and the one with the most flexibility.

### The Core Problem

JIRA has a list of test cases (PROJ-101, PROJ-102, PROJ-103).
Playwright has test functions written in code.
**How does the framework connect these two?**

### The Answer: ANNOTATIONS (our chosen approach)

Each Playwright test function has a **label** (annotation) that says:
*"I am the automated version of XRAY test case PROJ-101"*

```typescript
// In tests/login.test.ts — look for this pattern:

test(
  'TC01: Valid credentials should log the user in successfully',
  {
    annotation: { type: 'xray', description: 'PROJ-101' }
    //                           ↑ THIS is the link to JIRA XRAY
    //                             Change this to your actual test case key
  },
  async ({ page }) => {
    // ... test code here ...
  }
);
```

Think of this like **name tags at a conference**:
- The test function is a PERSON (the automation)
- The annotation `PROJ-101` is their NAME TAG
- XRAY test case PROJ-101 is their actual IDENTITY in JIRA

```
PLAYWRIGHT TEST FUNCTION          XRAY TEST CASE
─────────────────────────         ──────────────
test('TC01: Valid login',    ←──→  PROJ-101: "Verify login
  annotation: 'PROJ-101',          with valid credentials"
  async ({ page }) => {
    // opens browser             Steps:
    // types credentials          1. Open login page
    // clicks submit              2. Enter valid email
    // checks dashboard           3. Enter valid password
  }                               4. Click Login
)                                 5. Check dashboard loads
```

## 🔀 Section 6 — The 4 Ways to Map Tests (Choose What Fits Your Team)

> **This is the section about flexibility** — different teams do this differently.
> Here are all four approaches explained, with pros and cons of each.

---

### 🅐 Method 1: One-to-One Annotation (RECOMMENDED for beginners)

**How it works:** Each test has one annotation with the exact XRAY test case key.

```typescript
test('Login with valid credentials',
  { annotation: { type: 'xray', description: 'PROJ-101' } },
  async ({ page }) => { /* ... */ }
);

test('Login with wrong password',
  { annotation: { type: 'xray', description: 'PROJ-102' } },
  async ({ page }) => { /* ... */ }
);
```

**Visual mapping:**
```
Playwright Test File              XRAY Test Set PROJ-456
────────────────────              ──────────────────────
test [annotation: PROJ-101]  ←→  PROJ-101: Valid login
test [annotation: PROJ-102]  ←→  PROJ-102: Wrong password
test [annotation: PROJ-103]  ←→  PROJ-103: Empty fields
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Simplest to understand — one test = one XRAY case
- ✅ Crystal clear which code maps to which JIRA ticket
- ✅ Easy to add new tests (just add the annotation)

**Cons:**
- ❌ If XRAY test case keys change, you must update code

**Best for:** Small to medium teams, straightforward test suites

---

### 🅑 Method 2: Tags / Labels-Based Filtering

**How it works:** XRAY test cases have labels/tags. You run only tests with matching tags.
Instead of mapping by key, you tag tests in both places.

**In JIRA XRAY:** Assign labels to test cases:
```
PROJ-101 → labels: ["smoke", "login", "sprint5"]
PROJ-102 → labels: ["regression", "login", "sprint5"]
PROJ-103 → labels: ["smoke", "login", "sprint5"]
```

**In Playwright tests:**
```typescript
// Use Playwright's built-in tag system with @ prefix
test('@smoke @login TC01: Valid login', async ({ page }) => { /* ... */ });
test('@regression @login TC02: Wrong password', async ({ page }) => { /* ... */ });
```

**Run only "smoke" tests:**
```bash
npx playwright test --grep "@smoke"
```

**Run only "sprint5" tests:**
```bash
npx playwright test --grep "@sprint5"
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Very flexible — run any subset of tests by tag
- ✅ Natural for teams that already use labels in JIRA
- ✅ Easy to run "smoke only", "regression only", "sprint5 only"

**Cons:**
- ❌ Tags can get messy over time if not managed carefully
- ❌ The connection to a specific XRAY key is less explicit

**Best for:** Teams running different test subsets per sprint/environment

---

### 🅒 Method 3: Dynamic Mapping (Test name must match XRAY summary)

**How it works:** The framework fetches test case names from XRAY at runtime,
then matches them against Playwright test names automatically — no manual annotations needed.

**In XRAY, your test case is named:**
```
PROJ-101: "TC01 - Verify user can login with valid credentials"
```

**In Playwright, your test has the SAME name:**
```typescript
test('TC01 - Verify user can login with valid credentials', async ({ page }) => {
  // No annotation needed — name matching handles it automatically
});
```

**How the matching works:**
```
XRAY Test Cases fetched:                 Playwright Test Names:
────────────────────────                 ─────────────────────
"TC01 - Verify login..."          ←──→  "TC01 - Verify login..."  ✅ MATCH
"TC02 - Wrong password..."        ←──→  "TC02 - Wrong password..." ✅ MATCH
"TC03 - Empty fields..."          ←──→  (no match)                 ❌ NO MATCH
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ No annotations needed in test code
- ✅ XRAY is the single source of truth for test names
- ✅ Renaming in XRAY auto-updates the mapping

**Cons:**
- ❌ Test names must match EXACTLY (typos break the mapping)
- ❌ Harder to debug when things don't match
- ❌ Requires more complex setup code

**Best for:** Large teams where XRAY test case names are strictly standardized

---

### 🅓 Method 4: External Mapping File

**How it works:** A separate JSON file stores the mapping between XRAY keys and test names.
Neither the test code nor JIRA carries the mapping — it lives in its own file.

**Create a file `config/test-mapping.json`:**
```json
{
  "PROJ-101": "TC01: Valid credentials should log the user in",
  "PROJ-102": "TC02: Wrong password should show an error",
  "PROJ-103": "TC03: Empty credentials should show validation errors"
}
```

**Playwright reads this mapping and filters which tests to run:**
```typescript
// Framework reads the map and only runs tests whose names appear in the map
const mapping = require('../config/test-mapping.json');
// Tests not in the mapping are skipped automatically
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Mapping is centralized in one easy-to-edit file
- ✅ Non-developers can edit the JSON file without touching test code
- ✅ Easy to add/remove tests from a sprint without code changes

**Cons:**
- ❌ Another file to maintain
- ❌ Easy to have stale mappings (key changed in JIRA but not in JSON)

**Best for:** Teams with a dedicated QA manager who controls what runs each sprint

---

### 📊 Comparison Summary

| Method | Who edits the mapping? | Where is the link stored? | Best for |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------------|----------|
| **A: Annotation** | Developer | Inside test code | Small teams, simple cases |
| **B: Tags/Labels** | Anyone | JIRA labels + test names | Sprint-based filtering |
| **C: Name Match** | XRAY admin | XRAY test case name | Standardized naming teams |
| **D: JSON file** | QA Manager | Separate config file | Centralized control |

> **Our framework uses Method A (Annotations) as the default** because it's
> the most transparent for beginners. But you can switch to any other method
> by modifying `tests/xray-test-fixture.ts` — all the XRAY API plumbing
> stays the same regardless of which method you choose.

## ▶️ Section 7 — What Happens During Test Execution

Once setup is done and the Test Execution exists in JIRA, Playwright starts running tests.

### For Each Test:

```
PLAYWRIGHT                         xray-test-fixture.ts
──────────                         ────────────────────

"Starting test: TC01..."     ──→   Reads annotation: "PROJ-101"
                                   Logs: "Test linked to XRAY: PROJ-101"
                                   Records start time

[TEST RUNS]
 - Opens browser
 - Goes to /login
 - Types email
 - Types password
 - Clicks Submit
 - Checks dashboard loads

"Test finished: PASSED"      ──→   Maps Playwright "passed" → XRAY "PASS"
                                   No screenshot needed (test passed)
                                   Saves to xray-state.json:
                                   {
                                     testCaseKey: "PROJ-101",
                                     status: "PASS",
                                     duration: 3240ms
                                   }

"Starting test: TC02..."     ──→   Reads annotation: "PROJ-102"

[TEST RUNS]
 - Opens browser
 - Goes to /login
 - Types email
 - Types WRONG password
 - Clicks Submit
 - Checks for error message
 - ❌ ERROR: Expected "Invalid" but got "Error occurred"

"Test finished: FAILED"      ──→   Maps Playwright "failed" → XRAY "FAIL"
                                   Takes screenshot of browser at failure
                                   Saves to xray-state.json:
                                   {
                                     testCaseKey: "PROJ-102",
                                     status: "FAIL",
                                     errorMessage: "Expected 'Invalid'...",
                                     screenshotPath: "test-results/TC02_FAILURE.png",
                                     duration: 4100ms
                                   }
```

### What xray-state.json looks like after all tests run:

```json
{
  "executionKey": "PROJ-789",
  "sprintNumber": "5",
  "runStartedAt": "2026-03-03T10:00:00Z",
  "results": [
    {
      "testCaseKey": "PROJ-101",

      "status": "PASS",
      "durationMs": 3240,
      "startedAt": "2026-03-03T10:00:05Z",
      "finishedAt": "2026-03-03T10:00:08Z"
    },
    {
      "testCaseKey": "PROJ-102",
      "testName": "TC02: Wrong password should show an error message",
      "status": "FAIL",
      "errorMessage": "Expected error message to contain 'Invalid' but found 'Error occurred'",

    },
    {
      "testCaseKey": "PROJ-104",
      "testName": "TC04: GET /posts/1 should return status 200 and valid post data",
      "status": "PASS",

      "startedAt": "2026-03-03T10:00:14Z",
      "finishedAt": "2026-03-03T10:00:15Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🚶 Section 10 — First Time Setup: Your Step-by-Step Checklist

Follow these steps in order. Tick each one off before moving to the next.

```
□ Step 1: Install Node.js
          Go to https://nodejs.org → Download "LTS" → Install
          Verify: Open Terminal, type: node --version
          Should show: v18.x.x or higher

□ Step 2: Open the project folder in your Terminal
          Mac: Open Terminal → type: cd /path/to/your/project
          Windows: Open Command Prompt → type: cd C:\path\to\your\project

          XRAY_SPRINT_NUMBER   → e.g. 5
          BASE_URL             → e.g. https://myapp.staging.com

□ Step 7: In your test file (tests/login.test.ts)
          Find each annotation like:
            annotation: { type: 'xray', description: 'PROJ-101' }
          Change 'PROJ-101' to your ACTUAL XRAY test case keys

□ Step 8: Run the tests!
          Type: npm test
```

## ❓ Section 12 — Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What do I do MANUALLY vs what does Playwright do AUTOMATICALLY?**
> **You do manually (one time):**
> 1. Create Test Cases in JIRA XRAY (e.g., PROJ-101, PROJ-102)
> 2. Create a Test Set in JIRA XRAY (e.g., PROJ-456)
> 3. Add the Test Cases to the Test Set
> 4. Put the Test Set ID in `.env` (`XRAY_TEST_SET_ID=PROJ-456`)
> 5. Write the Playwright test with the annotation: `annotation: { type: 'xray', description: 'PROJ-101' }`
>
> **Playwright does automatically (every `npm test`):**
> 1. Authenticates with JIRA
> 2. Fetches test cases from the Test Set
> 3. Creates a new Test Execution ticket in JIRA
> 4. Runs all tests
> 5. Uploads PASS/FAIL results to JIRA
> 6. Attaches failure screenshots to JIRA
> 7. Generates the HTML report

---

**Q: I'm not a developer. Do I need to write code?**
> No! Once the framework is set up by a developer, your job is to:
> 1. Maintain test cases in JIRA XRAY (no code needed)
> 2. Update the `.env` file with the correct sprint number
> 3. Run `npm test` in the terminal
> The framework does everything else.

---

**Q: What if I don't have JIRA or XRAY?**
> The tests will still run! Playwright tests work independently.
> When JIRA connection fails, the framework logs a warning and skips the
> XRAY integration — tests run and results appear only in the terminal
> and the HTML report, but NOT in JIRA.

---

**Q: How do I add a new test for a new XRAY test case?**
> 1. **In JIRA (manual):** Create the test case (e.g., PROJ-110) with Issue Type = "Test"
> 2. **In JIRA (manual):** Open your Test Set (PROJ-456) and add PROJ-110 to it
> 3. **In code:** Open `tests/login.test.ts` (or create a new `.test.ts` file)
> 4. **In code:** Copy an existing test block and change:
>    - The test description (e.g., `'TC07: My new scenario'`)
>    - The annotation key to `'PROJ-110'`
>    - The test steps to match what PROJ-110 tests
> 5. **Run:** `npm test` — PROJ-110 will now report to JIRA automatically
>
> See **[CAPABILITIES.md → JIRA XRAY Integration](CAPABILITIES.md#-jira-xray-integration)**
> for the complete step-by-step guide with screenshots and best practices.

---

**Q: Can two Playwright tests map to the same XRAY test case?**
> Technically yes, but it's not recommended. The second result will
> overwrite the first in JIRA. Use one Playwright test per XRAY test case.

---

**Q: What is the HTML report and how do I see it?**
> After running tests, open the file `reports/execution-report-YYYY-MM-DD.html` in any browser.
> A new report is generated automatically after every `npm test` run.
> It shows:

**Q: How often should I update XRAY_SPRINT_NUMBER in .env?**
> Every sprint! Before starting a new sprint's test run, open `.env` and
> change the number. This ensures each sprint gets its own Test Execution
> in JIRA with a unique name.

---

**Q: What if JIRA is down when I run tests?**
> The global setup will fail and tests won't run. You'll see a clear error:
> `❌ GLOBAL SETUP FAILED: Cannot connect to JIRA!`
> Wait for JIRA to come back up, or temporarily disable the JIRA integration
> by setting `XRAY_TEST_SET_ID=SKIP` in `.env` (the framework detects this
> and skips XRAY entirely, letting tests run without JIRA).
