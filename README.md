## What Is This Project?

A one-command test framework that does three things automatically:

| Phase | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **Before tests** | Connects to JIRA → fetches test cases from XRAY → creates a Test Execution → seeds database (if configured) |
| **During tests** | Opens Chrome for UI tests, calls REST APIs for API tests, checks assertions, captures failure screenshots |
| **After tests** | Uploads PASS/FAIL to JIRA XRAY → attaches screenshots → generates HTML report → writes PASS/FAIL summary to log file → cleans up test data |

> **UI tests** (browser automation), **API tests** (direct backend calls), and **Navigation tests** (cross-site browsing) are all supported.
> All types report to JIRA XRAY and appear in the HTML report.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, you need to install:

| Tool | Why You Need It | How to Get It |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| **Node.js** (v18+) | Runs JavaScript/TypeScript on your machine | https://nodejs.org → Download "LTS" version |
| **npm** | Installs project dependencies (comes with Node.js) | Installed with Node.js |
| **Git** (optional) | Source control | https://git-scm.com |

**Verify your installations:**
```bash
node --version    # Should show v18.x.x or higher
npm --version     # Should show 9.x.x or higher
```

---

## First-Time Setup

### Step 1: Install all dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
This downloads all the libraries listed in `package.json` into the `node_modules/` folder.

### Step 2: Install Playwright browsers
```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```
This downloads the Chromium browser that Playwright uses for testing.
(You only need to do this once, or when you update Playwright.)

### Step 3: Set up your environment file
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
This copies the template to create your actual `.env` file.
Then open `.env` and fill in your real values (see next section).

---

## Configure Your Environment

Open the `.env` file and fill in your details:

```env
# ──── JIRA CONNECTION ────
# Your JIRA instance URL
JIRA_BASE_URL=https://your-company.atlassian.net

# Your JIRA email address
JIRA_USERNAME=your-email@company.com

# Your JIRA API Token
# Get it from: https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
JIRA_API_TOKEN=your-api-token-here

# ──── XRAY SETTINGS ────
# Your JIRA project key (visible in ticket numbers like "PROJ-123" → key is "PROJ")
XRAY_PROJECT_KEY=PROJ

# The XRAY Test Set ticket ID — created MANUALLY by QA in JIRA (Issue Type: "Test Set")
# This groups your test cases together. See CAPABILITIES.md for the full setup guide.
XRAY_TEST_SET_ID=PROJ-456

# Current Sprint number (update this at the start of each sprint)
XRAY_SPRINT_NUMBER=5

# ──── APP UNDER TEST ────
# The URL of the application you're testing
BASE_URL=https://your-app.com

# ──── ENCRYPTION (for encrypted passwords in YAML) ────
# Set a strong passphrase (min 16 characters). This enables ${ENC:...}
# auto-decryption in YAML test data files. Run: npm run encrypt-password
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-strong-passphrase-min-16-chars
```

### How to get a JIRA API Token:
1. Log into Jira → Click your profile picture (top-right)
2. Click **"Manage Account"**
3. Go to the **"Security"** tab
4. Click **"Create and manage API tokens"**
5. Click **"Create API token"**, give it a name (e.g., "Playwright Tests")
6. Copy the token and paste it into `.env` as `JIRA_API_TOKEN`

---

## How to Run Tests

All commands are run from the project root directory in your terminal:

```bash
# Run ALL tests (UI + API + Navigation + Iframe, with JIRA XRAY integration)
npm test

# Run ONLY the UI login tests (TC01–TC03)
npm run test:login

# Run ONLY the API tests (TC04–TC06)
npm run test:api

# Run ONLY the navigation tests (TC07–TC11)
npm run test:nav

# Run ONLY the iframe tests (TC12–TC13)
npm run test:iframe

# Run ALL tests with a VISIBLE browser window (good for debugging UI tests)
npm run run:headed

# Run ALL tests in headless mode (no visible window, faster — default)
npm run run:headless

# Run tests in DEBUG mode (step through tests interactively)
npm run test:debug

# Run tests with Playwright's visual UI mode
npm run test:ui

# View the Playwright HTML trace report after running tests
npm run test:report

# Check TypeScript for errors without running tests
npm run lint

# Encrypt a password for use in YAML files or .env
npm run encrypt-password
```

> **New to tests?** Just run `npm test` — it runs everything and generates the HTML report in `reports/`.

```

**View the HTML Execution Report:**

The HTML report is saved to `reports/execution-report-YYYY-MM-DD.html` automatically after every run.
Open it in any browser — it contains:
- Summary cards: total tests, pass rate, test type breakdown (UI vs API)
- Pass/Fail/Aborted status for each test with 🖥️ UI / 🔌 API badge
- Start time and duration per test
- Screenshots of failed tests (click to zoom)
- Step-by-step log accordion per test
- Accessibility (a11y) issues table
- Performance metrics table
- XRAY integration status and links

**View the Playwright Trace Report:**
```bash
npm run test:report
```
Opens Playwright's built-in trace viewer — great for replaying individual test steps.

## How the XRAY Integration Works

### The Manual-vs-Automated Boundary

```
✋ QA does MANUALLY (one-time in JIRA):        🤖 Playwright does AUTOMATICALLY (every run):
──────────────────────────────────────          ──────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Create Test Cases in XRAY (PROJ-101...)     5. Authenticates with JIRA
2. Create a Test Set (PROJ-456)                6. Fetches test cases from the Test Set
3. Add Test Cases to the Test Set              7. Creates a Test Execution (PROJ-789)
4. Put XRAY_TEST_SET_ID=PROJ-456 in .env       8. Runs tests + captures PASS/FAIL
                                                9. Uploads results + screenshots to JIRA
                                               10. Generates HTML report
```

### Each Sprint Checklist

```
□ (If needed) Create new Test Cases in JIRA for new features
□ (If needed) Update the Test Set with new/removed test cases
□ Update .env: XRAY_SPRINT_NUMBER=6 (and XRAY_TEST_SET_ID if changed)
□ Write new Playwright tests with annotation: { type: 'xray', description: 'PROJ-NEW' }
□ Run: npm test
□ Review: Open JIRA → find the new Test Execution → review results
```

> **JIRA not configured?** No problem. Set placeholder values in `.env` and tests run
> normally — the HTML report is still generated with full results.

---

## Adding New Tests

> **Non-developer?** Skip this section and read **[WRITE_A_TEST.md](WRITE_A_TEST.md)** instead — it's much simpler.

### Writing a UI Test (browser-based)

### Step 1: Create or open a test file
Create `tests/your-feature.test.ts` (or add to an existing test file).

### Step 2: Use this template:
```typescript
// Import our custom test function (includes XRAY integration + a11y scan)
import { test, expect } from './xray-test-fixture';

// Import the page object for the page you're testing
import { YourPage } from '../pages/YourPage';

test.describe('Your Feature Tests', () => {

  test(
    'TC01: Description of what this test checks',
    {
      // ⬇ LINK THIS TEST TO YOUR XRAY TEST CASE KEY ⬇
      annotation: { type: 'xray', description: 'PROJ-XXX' },
    },
    async ({ page }) => {
      const yourPage = new YourPage(page);

      // Navigate to the page
      await yourPage.navigateToPage();

      // Perform actions
      await yourPage.doSomething();

      // Assert the expected result
      await yourPage.verifyExpectedOutcome();
    }
  );

});
```

### Writing an API Test (direct backend call)

```typescript
import { test, expect } from './xray-test-fixture';
import { apiGet, apiPost } from '../utils';

test.describe('User API Tests', () => {

  test(
    'TC04: GET /users/1 should return valid user data',
    {
      annotation: { type: 'xray', description: 'PROJ-104' },
    },
    async () => {  // Note: no "page" needed for API tests
      const response = await apiGet('https://api.your-app.com/users/1');

      expect(response.status).toBe(200);
      expect(response.data).toHaveProperty('id', 1);
    }
  );

});
```

### Step 3: Run your new test:
```bash
npx playwright test tests/your-feature.test.ts
```

### 💡 Data-Driven Tip: Load Test Data from YAML

Instead of hardcoding test values (credentials, URLs, expected results), load them from external YAML files in `test-data/`. This makes tests reusable — change data without modifying code. You can also selectively run/skip tests using the `run: yes/no` toggle:

```typescript
import { getTestData, isTestEnabled } from '../utils/helpers/test-data-loader';

// In your test:
const td = getTestData('ui-tests.yaml', 'PROJ-101');
if (!isTestEnabled('ui-tests.yaml', 'PROJ-101')) test.skip(); // skip if run: no
await page.getByLabel('Username').fill(td.username as string);
await page.getByLabel('Password').fill(td.password as string);
```

YAML file structure (`test-data/ui-tests.yaml`):
```yaml
PROJ-101:
  run: yes                          # ← yes = run, no = skip
  testCase: "TC01: Valid login"
  username: "tomsmith"              # ← flat data fields (no nesting)
  password: "${ENC:U2FsdGVkX1+8pM...}"  # ← encrypted! (never plain text)
  expectedUrlFragment: "/secure"
```

> 🔐 **Encrypt passwords in YAML** — Use `${ENC:ciphertext}` to store encrypted values.
> Run `npm run encrypt-password` to generate the ciphertext. The loader auto-decrypts at runtime.
> See the [Encryption section in CAPABILITIES.md](CAPABILITIES.md#-security--encryption) for details.

---

## Adding New Page Objects

For every new PAGE in your application, create a new file in `pages/`.

### Step 1: Create `pages/DashboardPage.ts`:
```typescript
import { type Page } from '@playwright/test';
import { BasePage } from './BasePage';

export class DashboardPage extends BasePage {

  // Define locators for elements on this page
  private get welcomeHeading() {
    return this.page.getByRole('heading', { level: 1 });
  }

  constructor(page: Page) {
    super(page);
  }

  async navigateToDashboard() {
    await this.navigate('/dashboard');
  }

  async verifyDashboardLoaded() {
    await this.assertElementVisible(this.welcomeHeading, 'Dashboard heading');
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Use it in a test:
```typescript
import { DashboardPage } from '../pages/DashboardPage';

const dashboardPage = new DashboardPage(page);
await dashboardPage.navigateToDashboard();
await dashboardPage.verifyDashboardLoaded();
```

> **What is an iframe?** An `<iframe>` is a "page inside a page." Enterprise apps like **Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Workday** embed forms and editors inside iframes. Playwright **cannot** see elements inside an iframe with normal `page.locator()` — you must use our iframe helpers.

This framework provides **10 generic iframe helper methods** in `BasePage.ts` so you never have to manually "switch" in and out of frames like you would in Selenium.

### The Core Pattern (3 Steps — That's It)

```typescript
import { BasePage } from '../pages/BasePage';

// Step 1: Create a BasePage
const basePage = new BasePage(page);

// Step 2: Get the iframe handle (do this ONCE per iframe)
const frame = basePage.getIframe('#my-iframe');

// Step 3: Use helpers — NO switching, NO frame management
await basePage.fillInIframe(frame, '#name', 'John', 'Name field');
await basePage.clickInIframe(frame, '.save-btn', 'Save button');
await basePage.selectInIframe(frame, '#country', 'India', 'Country dropdown');
await basePage.assertTextInIframe(frame, '.msg', 'Saved!', 'Success message');

// Back to main page? Just use page.locator() — no switch needed
await expect(page.locator('#heading')).toBeVisible();
```

### All 10 Iframe Helper Methods

| Method | What It Does | Example |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| `getIframe(selector)` | Get an iframe handle | `const frame = basePage.getIframe('#myFrame')` |
| `getNestedIframe(outer, inner)` | Get an iframe inside another iframe | `const frame = basePage.getNestedIframe('#outer', '#inner')` |
| `locatorInIframe(frame, selector)` | Get a Locator inside an iframe | `const el = basePage.locatorInIframe(frame, 'h1')` |
| `fillInIframe(frame, selector, text, desc)` | Type into an input inside iframe | `await basePage.fillInIframe(frame, '#email', 'a@b.com', 'Email')` |
| `clickInIframe(frame, selector, desc)` | Click a button/link inside iframe | `await basePage.clickInIframe(frame, '.btn', 'Submit')` |
| `selectInIframe(frame, selector, value, desc)` | Pick a dropdown option inside iframe | `await basePage.selectInIframe(frame, '#dd', 'Option', 'DD')` |
| `typeInIframe(frame, selector, text, desc)` | Type into rich text editor inside iframe | `await basePage.typeInIframe(frame, '#body', 'Hello', 'Editor')` |
| `assertTextInIframe(frame, selector, text, desc)` | Verify text inside iframe | `await basePage.assertTextInIframe(frame, '.msg', 'OK', 'Msg')` |
| `assertVisibleInIframe(frame, selector, desc)` | Verify element visible inside iframe | `await basePage.assertVisibleInIframe(frame, '#name', 'Name')` |
| `getIframeFieldValue(frame, selector)` | Read input value inside iframe | `const val = await basePage.getIframeFieldValue(frame, '#name')` |
| `getIframeTextContent(frame, selector)` | Read text content inside iframe | `const txt = await basePage.getIframeTextContent(frame, '.label')` |

### Working with Multiple Iframes

```typescript
// Get handles for BOTH iframes — hold them simultaneously
const leadFrame    = basePage.getIframe('#lead-iframe');
const contactFrame = basePage.getIframe('#contact-iframe');

// Fill in iframe #1
await basePage.fillInIframe(leadFrame, '#name', 'John', 'Name');

// Jump to iframe #2 — just use the other handle (NO switchToDefault!)
await basePage.fillInIframe(contactFrame, '#city', 'Mumbai', 'City');

// Jump BACK to iframe #1 — just use the first handle again
const name = await basePage.getIframeFieldValue(leadFrame, '#name');
expect(name).toBe('John');

// Main page — just use page.locator() as normal
await expect(page.locator('#title')).toHaveText('My App');
```

### Complete Iframe Test Template — Copy & Paste

Save this as `tests/your-iframe-test.test.ts`:

```typescript
import path from 'path';
import { test, expect } from './xray-test-fixture';
import { BasePage } from '../pages/BasePage';
import { enhancedLogger } from '../utils/helpers/enhanced-logger';
import { getTestData, isTestEnabled } from '../utils/helpers/test-data-loader';

const DATA_FILE = 'ui-tests.yaml';

test.describe('Your Iframe Tests', () => {

  test('TC##: Fill form fields inside an iframe', {
    annotation: { type: 'xray', description: 'PROJ-XXX' },
  }, async ({ page, xrayTestKey }) => {
    const td = getTestData(DATA_FILE, 'PROJ-XXX');
    if (!isTestEnabled(DATA_FILE, 'PROJ-XXX')) test.skip();

    const basePage = new BasePage(page);

    // Navigate to your page
    enhancedLogger.step('Step 1: Navigate to the page', xrayTestKey);
    await page.goto('https://your-app.com/record');        // ← CHANGE

    // Get the iframe
    enhancedLogger.step('Step 2: Get the iframe handle', xrayTestKey);
    const frame = basePage.getIframe('#your-iframe');       // ← CHANGE

    // Fill fields inside the iframe
    enhancedLogger.step('Step 3: Fill form fields', xrayTestKey);
    await basePage.fillInIframe(frame, '#field1', td.value1 as string, 'Field 1');  // ← CHANGE
    await basePage.fillInIframe(frame, '#field2', td.value2 as string, 'Field 2');  // ← CHANGE

    // Verify
    enhancedLogger.step('Step 4: Verify', xrayTestKey);
    const actual = await basePage.getIframeFieldValue(frame, '#field1');
    expect(actual).toBe(td.value1);

    enhancedLogger.pass('TC## passed', xrayTestKey);
  });
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### ❌ "Missing required environment variable: JIRA_BASE_URL"
**Fix:** Make sure your `.env` file exists and has the correct values.
```bash
cat .env   # Check if file exists and has content
```

### ❌ "Cannot connect to JIRA"
**Fix:** Check your `.env` credentials:
- Is `JIRA_BASE_URL` correct? (e.g., `https://company.atlassian.net`)
- Is your `JIRA_API_TOKEN` valid? (generate a new one if expired)
- Do you have internet access?

### ❌ "Test case PROJ-101 not found in execution"
**Fix:** Make sure the test case key in your test annotation matches the keys
in your XRAY Test Set (`XRAY_TEST_SET_ID` in `.env`).

### ❌ "Browser not installed"
**Fix:** Run: `npx playwright install chromium`

### ❌ TypeScript errors
**Fix:** Run `npm run lint` to see all type errors, then fix them.

### 🐛 Tests are failing but you're not sure why
**Fix:** Run with a visible browser:
```bash
npm run test:headed
```
Or use the interactive debugger:
```bash
npm run test:debug
```
